# ToDoLy 5000

## User Manual

ToDoLy 5000 operates by taking user input from the keybord. Every time our application asks you do do something (like Pick an option, enter new name) - it expects You, our dear user, to type something on the keybord and hit enter. Silly as that. Just read the instruction on the screen, type something relevant and everyone should be fine.

## Show Task List

To show list of tasks type 1 in the initial menu.  It will take you to another menu, when you can specify what tasks do you want to see. For example, you can check the expired tasks - for that, press number 6. While looking for tasks from a specific project, or for a specific date, user will be asked to type the name of that project or specific date. Use your keybort to input those information, and, if such things exist, you will be rewarded with a list of tasks. If not, program will go back to menu.

## Add new task

User can add tasks to already existing projects or to new projects. Selecting new project will create (for users convenience) a new project in our list.

### Adding task to existing project.

User needs to choose to which from already existing projects one wants to add another task. User will be given a list of existing projects - by typing a name of an existing project user is selecting, where new task will be saved. After selecting a project a list of already existing tasks will be displayed. This should help avoid adding the same task for a second time (unless of course it's the same task, but with a different date - we believe in intelligence of our users). After that user will be asked to give a new task name (f.ex. buy flowers) and due date. 

### Adding task to a new project

New project will be created - first thing, user has to type a new, significant name for the project (f.ex. Bake a cake). Then, the procedure looks the same as with adding tasks to existing projects.

## Edit task

Tasks can be edited in three ways: 

1. User can update the information about the task - change name and due date
2. User can mark taks as done.
3. User can remove task from project.

First thing to do is to select a project, from which user wants to edit a task. User will be given a list of existing projects - by typing a name of an existing project user is selecting, where task will be edited. After selecting a project, user will be asked what editing operation he want to perform: 1.Update, 2. Mark as done, 3.Remove task. Then, the list with all existing tasks will be printed, and user will choose the one to change. To choose task to edit, user should type an index of a task (not name).

### Update task

After selecting a task to update, user will be asked to choose what type of information will be changed: task name, or due date. After that user will provide a new value for either task name or task due date. The list of all tasks in the project will be provided in the end to make sure, that the entered values are correct.

### Mark as done

After selecting task to mark as done system will automatically update value. The list of all tasks in the project will be provided in the end to make sure, that changes were saved.

### Remove task

After selecting taks to remove system will automatically remove value. The list of all tasks in the project will be provided in the end to make sure, that changes were saved.

## Save and quit

All changes will be saved in a file on a hard drive. Program will quit.
