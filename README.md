# ToDoLy 5000

## SDA Individual Project.

Imagine a world, where trains depart on time. Always. Where you don't have to wait in a line for a doctor's appointment. Where all your work buddies are always up to date with things they were supposed to do. It's a world where you don't have to delay your project, because Brenda from Finance has a sick kid again. Here dishes are always clean, laundry is folded and everything smells like cotton candy. Welcome to world of ToDoLy 5000. 

ToDoLy5000 is a cutting edge application to store your everyday tasks in a very modern and safe text file on your hard drive. We give you a product, where you can create your own projects, with name and stuff, and then, fill them with various things to do. You want to bake a cake, but you keep forgetting about buying milk and eggs? Not anymore. Thanks to our sophisticated loops and System.out.prinlns (in your face, AI!) ToDoLy 5000 will make you remember not only about groceries, but also about upcoming parties, socially awkward encounters, your kids dumb plays and many more.

Choose ToDoLy 5000 and embrace the biggest change of your life. 

## Features

ToDoLy 5000 is like a high tech bucket list that stores your tasks and projects. What makes it special, amongst other lousy bukcet lists, is use of highly sophisticated features. 

### Showing tasks

I know, right? You can get all tasks at once. You can only get few tasks. You can get tasks for a specific date or choosen project. When it comes to getting tasks, ToDoLy 5000 will give them to you.

### Sorting tasks

We know - that is some serious stuff, and you can ask yourself - am I really getting all this? Is it Christmas time already? Our answer is YES! We are making bucket lists GREAT AGAIN! You can sort your tasks by project, you can sort them by date, you can sort them however you want. Isn't that great? 

### Adding tasks

Keep forgeting about your dentist appointment? Add it to list. Silent days at home, because another anniversary escaped your mind? Why not to add it to a list. Taking your date to a Starbucks, because you forgot her(or his) name? You see where I'm going with this? Adding things to our list will change your life. Forever! And we provided it, just for you. 

### Removing tasks

Nothing special here. Just removes tasks.

## Support

We believe in our customers, that's why we didn't provide any form of support. Ask yourself this - in a world, where you have to be a lion or shark or any other dangerous creature (dinosaur, maybe?) - do you really want to admit to yourself and to the whole world, that your incapable of doing something, that you are not the lion (or dinosaur)? Yeah, that's what I thought. Don't be a wimp, life is not just a bed of roses.

Eventualy, you can write an e-mail to Johan Ravnborg, he approved this project - just google him, he lives somewhere in Lund.
